# JavaScript, JS Engines, and Web Standards (ES6, HTML5, CSS3)

## 1. JavaScript and JavaScript Engines

### What is JavaScript?
JavaScript (JS) is a **high-level, interpreted** programming language used primarily for web development. It allows developers to create **dynamic, interactive** web pages by manipulating HTML and CSS, handling events, and interacting with web servers.

### What is a JavaScript Engine?
A JavaScript engine is a program that **executes JavaScript code**. It takes the JS code, parses it, converts it into an intermediate representation (**bytecode**), and then compiles it into **machine code** that can run on the CPU.

### Why Do Different Browsers Have Different JavaScript Engines?
Each browser has its own JavaScript engine to execute JS efficiently. Since each engine is developed independently, their **optimization techniques** and **performance** vary.

#### List of JavaScript Engines:
| Browser | JavaScript Engine |
|---------|------------------|
| Google Chrome, Edge | **V8** |
| Mozilla Firefox | **SpiderMonkey** |
| Apple Safari | **JavaScriptCore (Nitro)** |
| Microsoft Internet Explorer (Legacy) | **Chakra** |

Each engine uses **JIT (Just-In-Time) compilation**, but their **optimizations differ**, leading to **slight variations in performance and compatibility**.

## 2. ECMAScript (ES) & ES6

### What is ECMAScript (ES)?
ECMAScript is the **standard** on which JavaScript is based. The **ECMA International organization** defines the ES specification to ensure all JavaScript engines follow a common set of rules.

### Evolution of ECMAScript:
| Version | Year | Key Features |
|---------|------|--------------|
| ES5 | 2009 | Strict mode, JSON support, Array methods |
| ES6 (ES2015) | 2015 | `let`, `const`, arrow functions, classes, template literals |
| ES7+ | 2016+ | Async/Await, optional chaining, promises, modules |

### ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) â€“ Key Features:
1. **`let` and `const`** (Block-scoped variables)
2. **Arrow Functions** (`=>`) - Shorter syntax for functions
3. **Template Literals** (Backticks `` `Hello ${name}` ``)
4. **Destructuring** (`const {name, age} = obj;`)
5. **Classes & Modules** (`class MyClass {}` & `import/export`)
6. **Promises & Async/Await** (Better asynchronous handling)

## 3. HTML5 & CSS3

### What is HTML5?
HTML5 is the **latest version** of HTML (HyperText Markup Language), introduced to provide better **multimedia support, semantic elements, and API integration**.

#### Key Features of HTML5:
- **Semantic Elements** (`<header>`, `<section>`, `<article>`)
- **Multimedia Support** (`<audio>` and `<video>` without plugins)
- **Canvas API** (2D graphics rendering)
- **LocalStorage & IndexedDB** (Better offline support)
- **WebSockets & Web Workers** (For real-time communication and background tasks)

### What is CSS3?
CSS3 (Cascading Style Sheets) is the latest version of CSS, used for styling web pages with better **layouts, animations, and responsiveness**.

#### Key Features of CSS3:
- **Flexbox & Grid Layout** (Better control over page structure)
- **Animations & Transitions** (Smooth effects)
- **Media Queries** (Responsive design for different devices)
- **Custom Fonts (`@font-face`) & Variables (`--theme-color`)**

---

## Summary:
- JavaScript engines **execute JS code**, and each browser has its own engine (V8, SpiderMonkey, etc.).
- ECMAScript (**ES6 and later**) defines modern JavaScript features.
- HTML5 enhances **web structure** and **multimedia support**.
- CSS3 improves **styling, layouts, and animations** for responsive design.

These technologies **work together** to build modern, interactive web applications.


# JavaScript Compilation and Execution Lifecycle
JavaScript is both **compiled** and **interpreted**. It is executed in the following steps:

## 1. Parsing (Lexical Analysis)
- JavaScript code is **parsed** into tokens by the JavaScript engine.
- Syntax errors are detected at this stage.

## 2. Compilation (Just-in-Time Compilation - JIT)
- JavaScript is **compiled into bytecode** just before execution.
- The JavaScript engine optimizes the code during this step.

## 3. Execution
- The **Call Stack** executes synchronous code line by line.
- Asynchronous operations are sent to the **Web APIs** (e.g., setTimeout, fetch).
- The **Event Loop** moves completed async tasks back to the Call Stack.

### Example Execution Flow:
```javascript
console.log("Start");
setTimeout(() => console.log("Timeout Callback"), 0);
console.log("End");
```
#### Steps:
1. "Start" is logged.
2. `setTimeout` is called, sending its callback to Web APIs.
3. "End" is logged.
4. The Event Loop moves the callback back to the Call Stack when the main thread is free.
5. "Timeout Callback" is logged.

This shows how JavaScript compiles and executes code efficiently using an asynchronous model.
